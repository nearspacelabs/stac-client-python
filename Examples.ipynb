    "Proto3, the version of proto definition used for gRPC STAC, creates messages that are similar to structs in C. One of the drawbacks to structs is that for floats, integers, enums and booleans all fields that are not set are initialized to a value of zero. In geospatial sciences, defaulting to zero can cause problems in that an algorithm or user might interpret that as a true value. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get around this, Google uses wrappers for floats and ints and some of those are used in gRPC STAC. For example, some of the fields like `off_nadir`, `azimuth` and others in the Electro Optical protobuf message, [Eo](https://geo-grpc.github.io/api/#epl.protobuf.Eo), use the `google.protobuf.FloatValue` wrapper. As a consequence, accessing those values requires calling `field_name.value` instead of `field_name` to access the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our ground sampling distance query we're using another query filter; this time it's the [FloatField](https://geo-grpc.github.io/api/#epl.protobuf.FloatField). It behaves just as the TimestampField, but with floats for `value` or for `start` + `stop`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to make our off nadir query we need to insert it inside of an [EoRequest](https://geo-grpc.github.io/api/#epl.protobuf.EoRequest) container and set that to the `eo` field of the `StacRequest`.\n"
